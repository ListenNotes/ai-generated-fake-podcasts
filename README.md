## A public letter to the Notebook LM team:

Dear Notebook LM team,

We urgently request the development of a robust tool to reliably detect content generated by Notebook LM. The podcasting community, in particular, is experiencing a surge of spam in the form of audio files created by this tool. Unfortunately, blackhat SEO practitioners and scammers have quickly adopted Notebook LM for their purposes.

To address this, we’ve created a simple detection tool, [NotebookLM Detector](https://github.com/ListenNotes/notebooklm-detector), complete with a working model. While it currently performs well, we recognize that as Notebook LM continues to evolve, this will become an ongoing arms race. Eventually, it’s possible that tools like Notebook LM will generate audio files indistinguishable from human-produced content.

This raises serious concerns about the future. Misinformation, spamming, and scamming activities are likely to increase.

Is this the kind of future we want AI to bring into our lives?

We urge you to consider this growing issue and provide the necessary resources to help combat the misuse of AI-generated content.

Sincerely,

Listen Notes, Inc.
